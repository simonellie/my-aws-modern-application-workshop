# Build a Modern Application on AWS

Course execution from [this repository] this repository (java branch).

## Module 1

This first section will cover [s3] console usage for bucket creation and access.
It's possible to use cli, such as in [module-1 explain], or using console.
In the first case, it's necessary to create a [cloud9] workspace and call cli commands from created workspace.

## Module 2

For full time I follow instructions available in [module-2 explain] page.
